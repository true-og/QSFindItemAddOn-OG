## Features
- Search items based on buying/selling shops
- Search items by item type
- Supports query based item search
- Supports item custom model data for custom items
- Configurable shop sorting methods
- Displays enchantments in the result for enchanted items
- Hides item enchants if item has hide_enchants flag
- Displays potion effects in the result for Potion items
- Hide certain shops from appearing in search lists
- Supports completely safe direct shop teleportation (configurable in config.yml)
- Ignores shops that are out of stock by default
- Support for world blacklisting (Shops in blacklisted worlds are ignored in the search result)


**QuickShop-Hikari Support**
- It supports both [QuickShop-Reremake](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/62575/) and [QuickShop-Hikari](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/100125/).

**Hexcode color support**
- All messages in the config.yml support hexcodes.

**View all shops on server**
- You can do `/finditem TO_BUY *` or `/finditem TO_SELL *` to view all shops on the server. As of this version, the sequence is always randomized. Sorting options are a work in progress.

**Shop visit count**
- You can choose to display shop visits count in the shop lore in Search GUI. Just add the placeholder `{SHOP_VISITS}` in the `shop-gui-item-lore` in config.yml. To prevent visit spamming, a new config property `shop-player-visit-cooldown-in-minutes` has been added. Please don't use decimals here. 😁

**Customizable command aliases**
- You can find a property in config.yml called `command-alias` where you can specify your own list of command aliases for /finditem command. If you don't wish to add any, just make it as:
```yaml
command-alias: []
```

## Integrations
- Supports [PlayerWarps](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/66692/) (by Olzie-12) integration. It shows the nearest warp to each shop in the search result GUI.
- Supports EssentialsX Warps integration for fetching nearest warps.
    - Global warps list for essentials is updated in batches every 15 minutes due to technical limitations, which is then used in every search query.
    - If you added a new warp and want it to get updated immediately, run **/finditemadmin reload**
    - Remember, this applies only to Essential Warps.
- WorldGuard region support for fetching the WorldGuard region the shop is in (if overlapping regions, highest priority will be chosen)
